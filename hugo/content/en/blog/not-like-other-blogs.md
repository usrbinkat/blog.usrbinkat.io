From motivation, to setup, & deployment - let's talk about this blog and how it's built.

## Yet another tech blog?

Yes it's yet another tech blog, and like many, this one may go neglected from time to time, or be filled with half baked ideas until a longer running theme emerges.

### Interest

Having been privileged to gain a range of experience across many recognizable companies and a couple ground breaking startups, I've developed enough experience to feel strongly opinionated on some matters, and also deeply interested in how the next chapters of tech and technology's impact on the global social fabric will unfold.

### Motive

I've recently experienced a shift in my goals as a technologist, from a curiosity driven desire to learn and grow my skills and an isolated passion for playing with and building cloud technology, to a new core drive to scale the skills and knowledge I've gained in the hopes of paying forward and giving back to the community that literally gifted me the life I'm in love with living today.

### Origin

My tech origins come from garage tinkering and my attachment to open source began as the economic symptom of enough financial security in my needs being met, but little discretionary means of paying for extras and novelties beyond necessity itself.

I am not college educated, and as an [autodiadact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) I've leaned heavily on the self education skills developed during my primary education homeschooling years. Without Open Source Software and the brilliant and giving community built around it, I'm not sure how else I could have found my way to a successful career via any other path.

### Journey

Beginning in enterprise support roles I first learned how to communicate in a leading but kind manner to guide sometimes unwilling audiences towards best possible outcomes.

Diving into field engineering and consulting roles from there, I experienced a growth from being able to communicate on demand, to learning a new fluency in proactive communication, opinion based leadership, and growing into my own as a decision maker and cloud expert in my domain.

Most recently, I've had the great privilege to serve the cloud developer community as a Developer Advocate delivering community focused guides, blogs, talks, and videos on cloud native technology and developer tools.

### Voice

So far in my career, I have largely selected the stories I tell and tempered how I tell them to match the audiences my employers were most interested in reaching. Giving credit where it is due, the road to finding my voice was largely dependent on the professional experience and even mentorship I've benefited from, so I mean nothing disparaging by my recognition of past constraints.

Until now I've considered a personal blog to be a luxury of those with the time to invest in one. Suddenly however I find myself needing a personal outlet for promoting the stories that are personally interesting to me, in the style and voice that is most genuine and rewarding to my own spirit.
